    <h2 style="color:blueviolet"> For this homework I georeferenced an aerial image of UNC using a high resolution ortho image. I did this using six ground control points.   </h2>
    <p> I chose an image that depicts a track and some of the UNC athletic facilities, and although there is not much change over time, you can see where some storage facilities have been moved to make room for a new field.
